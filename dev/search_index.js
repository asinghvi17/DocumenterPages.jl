DocumenterPages.jl provides a flexible way to define page structures in Documenter.jl documentation.\n\nWhen building documentation with Documenter.jl, you typically need to specify the pages and their hierarchy in the pages keyword argument of makedocs. However, the default syntax can become unwieldy for complex documentation structures with many nested pages and sections.\n\nThis package introduces the PageNode type that makes it easier to:\n\nDefine hierarchical page structures in a more natural way\nControl page visibility and collapsing behavior\n\nFor example, it's impossible to have a page that is also a section in Documenter.jl.  Let's say I have an example gallery, and other individual example pages.\n\nCurrently, I would have to structure it so that the gallery is a separate toplevel section, and the individual examples are children of some other toplevel section:\n\npages = [\n    \"Home\" => \"index.md\",\n    \"Gallery\" => \"gallery.md\",\n    \"Examples\" => [\n        \"helk.md\",\n        \"park.md\"\n    ]\n]\n\nBut what if I want a user to be able to click on the \"Examples\" section, and have it take them to the gallery page?\n\nWith DocumenterPages.jl, I can do this:\n\npages = [\n    \"Home\" => \"index.md\",\n    PageNode(\"Examples\" => \"gallery.md\", [\"helk\" => \"helk.md\", \"park\" => \"park.md\"])\n]\n\nand now the \"Examples\" page is clickable (as you can see in this documentation), and it has children that are also clickable.\n\nThat's the idea behind DocumenterPages!","category":"section"},{"location":"park/#Park","page":"Park","title":"Park","text":"","category":"section"}]
